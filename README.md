# Pawxel

**Pawxel** is a personal mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 using [StationAPI-Template](https://github.com/calmilamsy/stationapi-example-mod).  
It's a sandbox-style client-side mod where I add anything I find useful, fun, or just feel like implementing — all while keeping the feel of classic Beta.



## 📁 Requirements

- Minecraft Beta 1.7.3
- [Babric (e.g Prisminstance)](https://github.com/babric/prism-instance)

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Set up a Beta 1.7.3 Babric-compatible instance (Betacraft Launcher recommended)
2. Drop `pawxel-x.x.x.jar` into your `mods` folder
3. Launch the game!

## 🧪 Disclaimer

This is a personal passion project. Expect rapid changes, weird features, and broken things. Not all features may be stable or fully polished.
